# ATLAS/LMTI RFC Archive

RFCs are archived research notes for ATLAS/LMTI.

They are not current product documentation and they are not implementation
tickets. Some older RFCs use broader "Artificial Mind", "cognitive kernel",
"server", "dashboard", "plugin" or commercial language. Treat that language as
historical vision unless it is restated in the root README or current docs.

For current scope, use:

```text
README.md
ROADMAP.md
docs/architecture.md
docs/privacy-model.md
docs/verification-model.md
docs/adapter-contract.md
docs/cli.md
docs/development.md
```

The current product scope is local-first project memory and verification for AI
coding agents, with Codex as the first workflow.

## Research Engineer Rule

Before accepting an RFC, the Research Engineer must ask:

* Why does this need to exist?
* What cognitive problem does it solve?
* What does it refuse to do?
* How does it protect knowledge?
* How does it evolve?
* What are the security risks?
* What are the scaling risks?
* What alternatives were rejected?

evolution path are explicit.
